// Best resources for programming in D3 for boilerplate code:

// D3 community is well-organized for sharing reusable code


// Appropriate small, useful chunks from other peoples projects for your own:
// bl.ocks.org
// blockbuilder.org


// Converting D3 version 4 to version 5

//  Data loading uses promises (I already knew this)
//  d3.schemeCategory20 color scheme removed (colors were too similar or something iunno)
